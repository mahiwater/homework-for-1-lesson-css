  <P ID="m1"> 🎨 What is CSS?
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, used for describing the presentation
of a document written in a markup language like HTML or XML. While HTML provides the fundamental structure and content
of a webpage (like the text, images, and links), CSS handles the style—that is, how the content looks. This separation
of concerns is a core principle of modern web development, allowing developers to manage the design of an entire website
from a centralized location. Without CSS, web pages would be plain, unstyled text documents, making them difficult to
navigate and visually unappealing.</P>
<p class="m2">🏗 The Syntax and Core Function
The basic building block of CSS is the rule set, which consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector
targets the HTML element(s) to be styled (e.g., all paragraph tags or an element with a specific class). The declaration
block contains one or more declarations, each a pairing of a CSS property and a corresponding value, separated by a
colon (e.g., color: blue; or font-size: 16px;). These properties govern aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and
animations. The power of CSS lies in its intuitive, human-readable syntax, which makes styling complex documents
relatively straightforward. </p>
<p class="m3"> 🔗 How CSS is Applied to HTML
There are three primary ways to apply CSS styles to an HTML document. The first is external stylesheets, where the CSS
is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML via the
<link> tag in the document's head. This is the most recommended method, as it promotes the separation of structure and
style. The second is internal CSS, written within a <style>
 tag in the HTML head. The third,
 and least recommended for large-scale use,
 is inline CSS,
 where styles are applied directly to an element using the style attribute. Understanding these methods is crucial,
 as the cascading nature of CSS determines which rule ultimately takes precedence.</p>
